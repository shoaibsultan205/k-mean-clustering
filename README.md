# k-mean-clustering
This project uses K-Means clustering on the World Life Expectancy dataset to group countries by female, male, and overall life expectancy. The optimal number of clusters is found using the Elbow Method. Clusters are visualized with colors and centroids, with meaningful names: Very Low, Low, Medium, High Life Expectancy.
